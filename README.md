                    password: "bar"

        commands:
            deploy:
                steps:
                    -

Variables
=========
You may want to commit your .anchour file without some informations like passwords and hosts ... To do that, Anchour allows you to define some required variables in your connections like this


    connections:
        MyFTP:
            type: ftp
            options:
                host: %my_host%
                username: %my_username%
                password: %my_password%

    commands:
        deploy:
            description: Deploy using FTP
            

            steps:
                -
                    type: ftp
                    options:
                        remote_dir: %folder%
                    connections:
                        connection: MyFTP


When you run the command deploy (described above), anchour will detect all the required variables for your command, asks you their values, and use them in the right places (example: %my_username% will be replaced by the value of the variable my_username)
